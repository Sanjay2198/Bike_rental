Task 1: Data Analysis
Explored trends in daily bike rentals.

Key insights:

More rentals on working days compared to weekends.
Rentals peak during spring and summer seasons.
Temperature and clear weather positively affect rental counts.
Rainy and humid days show a noticeable drop in rentals.
Task 2: Predictive Modeling
Built models to predict daily rental counts using features like:

Season, weather, temperature, humidity, windspeed.
Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting performed well.

Temperature and weather conditions were the most important predictors.


Result:
Bike Rental Demand Prediction (Regression Model) - Built and trained regression models including Random Forest Regressor. - Achieved 98.4% accuracy on training data and 83.8% on test data. - Applied cross-validation, feature selection, and evaluated with RMSE and MAE metrics. - Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
